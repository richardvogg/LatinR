# LatinR

Fuzzy merging (or also called Fuzzy matching) is a way to map text that is written differently (e.g. Richard Vogg, RICHARD VOGG, Richard.vogg) to the same entity.

In this repository I uploaded the material I used at the LatinR Conference 2019 in Santiago de Chile. A lot more material - from the keynote speakers Hadley Wickham, Mine Ã‡etinkaya-Rundel, Erin LeDell and many other great speakers can be found [here](https://github.com/LatinR/presentaciones-LatinR2019).
